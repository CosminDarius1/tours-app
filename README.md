In this Tour project I managed to:
-Fetch the tours data in App compenent;<br>
-Create 3 component Tour, Tours and Loading and their particular functionality;
-Added a Remove button for each component, so when the 'remove button' its clicked, the Tours component updates its state to remove the tour from tours array;
-Added 'Read more' button, and when this button its clicked , updates its state to toggle a 'read more' flag and renders the full description
-Added 'Refresh' button and when this button is clicked, the Tours component re-fetches the tours data from the URL and updates its state
