In this Tours project I managed to:<br>
<br>-Fetch the tours provided data using useEffect hook function;<br>
<br>-Create 3 component Tour, Tours and Loading and their particular functionality;<br>
<br>-Added a Remove button for each component, so when the 'remove button' its clicked, the Tours component updates its state to remove the tour from tours array;<br>
<br>-Added 'Read more' button, and when this button its clicked , updates its state to toggle a 'read more' flag and renders the full description;<br>
<br>-Added 'Refresh' button and when this button is clicked, the Tours component re-fetches the tours data from the URL and updates its state;<br>
